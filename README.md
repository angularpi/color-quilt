# color-quilt<strong>Objective:</strong> the idea is to have a construction block that allows the creation of quilts using any set of images (e.g. color squares).

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-104 size-thumbnail" src="http://angularpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/quilt-150x150.png" alt="quilt" width="150" height="150" />

<strong>Approach:</strong> given a list of colors, the script picks a random color and drops each square row by row.

Feeling creative? Use your Instagram pictures to make a mural.

<strong>Results:</strong> this is a sample output with the current configuration. Give it a try to create bigger quilts, or do rectangles instead of squares.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-104 size-full" src="http://angularpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/quilt.png" alt="quilt" width="440" height="440" />

<strong>Code:</strong>

[pastacode lang="python" user="ospanton" repos="color-quilt" path_id="color.py" revision="" highlight="" lines="" provider="github"/]
The python code begins by importing the required modules. The "image" module allows to open, manipulate and create images (find reference in this <a href="http://effbot.org/imagingbook/image.htm">link</a>)
